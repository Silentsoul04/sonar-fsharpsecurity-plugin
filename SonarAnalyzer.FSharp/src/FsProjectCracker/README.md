# FsProjectCracker

The project contains code to extract the build information from a `fs.proj` file.

It imports the proj-info library from https://github.com/enricosada/dotnet-proj-info
and copies some of the command line code from there as well.

Big thanks to [Enrico Sada](https://github.com/enricosada) and the other maintainers of that project!
