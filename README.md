# sonar-fsharpsecurity-plugin

sonar-fsharpsecurity-plugin is a F# plugin for SonarQube focused on security/vuln scanning only.

## Rationale

Many enterprises use the SonarC# and SonarVB static code analysers for scanning C# and VB.NET code to check for security and vulnerability issues.

In some cases, this scanning is *required* before deployment. For another .NET language such as F# to be accepted at these companies, an equivalent scanning tool is required.
The lack of such a tool is a hard blocker for F# acceptance.

SonarQube themselves have not built an F# plugin, hence this project.

The code is closely based on the C# code at https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet.
It uses exactly the same test suites (translated to F#) and the same rules (translated to F#).
This is to short circuit any complaints about the logic used. If it's good enough for C#, it's good enough for F#!

## Features

* 19 "Security Hotspot" rules have been ported from C# ([C# rules here](https://rules.sonarsource.com/csharp)).
* 26 "Vulnerabilities" rules are coming soon.


## How to run SonarQube locally 

NOTE: You will need a recent version of the JDK (v11 or newer). If you don't have it, follow instructions below on "Installing Java and Maven".

Install SonarQube:

1. Install the demo version of SonarQube. [Instructions here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/).
1. Run the server with `StartSonar.bat` and make sure you can see the site at http://localhost:9000. Make sure `JAVA_HOME` or equivalent is set.

Install the plugin:

1. Download [the plugin `sonar-fsharpsecurity-plugin.jar` file from Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/swlaschin/sonar-fsharpsecurity-plugin/build/artifacts).
1. Shut down SonarQube, then copy the plugin `sonar-fsharpsecurity-plugin.jar` file to the [SonarQube plugins directory](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-plugin/) and restart SonarQube.

Prepare for using SonarScanner:

1. [Get a user token, aka login key](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/user-token/).
1. Install [SonarScanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/).

Now you can try running the scanner!

1. In the SonarQube UI, create a project such as `myProject`.
1. Go to the directory containing the F# project
1. Run the following (assumes that `sonar-scanner.bat` is not already on your path and your login token is `01234567890`)

```
set JAVA_HOME=path\to\jdk // optional
set SONARSCANNER=path\to\sonar-scanner\bin
%SONARSCANNER%\sonar-scanner.bat -D"sonar.projectKey=myProject" -D"sonar.sources=." -D"sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000" -D"sonar.login=01234567890"
```

You can eliminate the need for the `host.url` and `login` parameters by editing `$install_directory/conf/sonar-scanner.properties`. 
([Instructions](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/)).

## To run directly without using the SonarQube server

The plugin contains an executable (`FsSonarRunner`) that can be run on its own. To use this:

1. Download the plugin as described above
1. Unzip the .JAR file to reveal the `SonarAnalyzer.FSharp.zip` 
1. Unzip `SonarAnalyzer.FSharp.zip` to reveal a `win-x86` directory. 
1. Copy this directory to your favorite location.

To run, just do:

```
FsSonarRunner
```

This will show the available command line options.

As a demonstration, try running it on the test cases which are part of the test suite

```
FsSonarRunner -d .\SonarAnalyzer.FSharp\tests\SonarAnalyzer.FSharp.UnitTest\TestCases
```

## How the plugin works

The plugin is a mix of Java (under `sonar-fsharpsecurity-plugin`) and F# (under `SonarAnalyzer.FSharp`).  

The plugin itself is written in Java and is loaded when `sonar-scanner` is used. The way it works is that Sonar provides a number of abstract classes which
the plugin then implements. 

* Sonar asks the plugin what file extensions it wants. The plugin returns `.fs` and `.fsproj`, etc.
* Sonar asks the plugin what rules it supports. In this case, the plugin returns the list using an XML file generated by the F# executable called `FsSolarRunner.exe` (using the `--export` option).
* The Sonar server may know that the user has asked for some of these rules not to run (to avoid the same errors over and over again)
* Sonar then passes the rules and the files into the plugin 
* The plugin analyzes those files. In this case the plugin:
  * writes those rules and files to an XML file
  * then executes the F# executable (`FsSolarRunner.exe`) passing that input file as parameter
  * the F# exe dumps out the results as files.
  * the plugin then reads these files in to memory
* Finally the plugin returns them to the Solar framework which stores them in the database associated with the server.

## Installing Java and Maven on Windows

To install on Windows, I recommend using the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/).

You'll need to install:

* [OpenJDK](https://chocolatey.org/packages/openjdk) using `choco install openjdk`
* For building, you'll also need [Maven](https://chocolatey.org/packages/maven) using `choco install maven`

## Installing Java and Maven on other platforms

Use your preferred package manager, such as `apt-get`.

Massive thanks to [jmecosta](https://github.com/jmecosta) and [milbrandt](https://github.com/milbrandt) for creating 
the [fslint SonarQube F# plugin](https://github.com/jmecsoftware/sonar-fsharp-plugin). I copied all the Java and maven code from that project
and I would never have been able to implement this plugin without that as an example!
